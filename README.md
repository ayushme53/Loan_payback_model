# Person-pays-back-loan-or-not-random-forest-model-

A random forest model and decision tree model to predict and classify if a person who has taken loan pays back money or not.

The project uses Python's inbuilt sklearn(sklearn.model_selection, sklearn.metrics and sklearn.ensemble) library to built random forest model and decision tree model separately and then compares both of them. 

The random forest model preforms better at every aspect than decision tree model when the number of estimators is taken as 150.

We have classified and done a detailed data-analysis of the data using Python's inbuilt matplotlib and seaborn library and further used pandas to creata data-frame. 

The random forest model's micro accuracy stands at 0.85 to 0.73 of the decision tree model.  

The confusion matrix has been printed at the end to give a detailed idea about the errors.  

The data-set has been taken from https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action.
